# open-journal-bonfire
<img src="client\src\assets\images\bonfire_site_icon.png">
Developing an anonymous "open journal" where anyone can freely write journal entries to the web. They can write whatever they want. The app will allow a set of journal entries to be made by anyone and up to a certain amount,
it will be "launched into the bonfire" where the entries will then be converted to stats.

Functionality to be developed:

1. View 10, 50, 200 journal entries, recent. You will get a set of journal entries and you can click to view each journal entry in detail
2. These entries will be thrown into a bonfire which will collect some data via keywords and event tags. The "bonfire" will collect the keywords and determine the overall mood, how many journal entries are positive,
and how many are negative.
3. View the details of a journal entry by clicking on a specific entry
4. View some statistics of the past 500 journal entries. These entries are then collected to form statistics which will serve as the "bonfire"
5. After like 500 or 1000 entries are made, the oldest entries will be discarded.
6. The entries you created will be saved via localhost.
7. Create a journal entry. The entries will each have
   -title
   -date
   -entry content
   -event tags

8. Bonfire contents (statistics) functionality will be proposed later on...
