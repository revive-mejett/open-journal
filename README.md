## Overview
Open Journal Bonfire is a web application allowing guests to create and/or view anonymous journal entries where they can freely share their days. The app will allow a set of journal entries to be made by anyone and up to a certain amount (ex: 500) and the recent 500 or so entries will be "launched into the bonfire". The bonfire feature is that the data of the recent entries are analyzed into statistics, displaying metrics such as % of positive and negative self-rated entries, and most frequently used keyword tags.

## Features

1. `👁️Viewing Entries`: Guests can view other guests' anonymous journal entries. They can filter certain entries (Positive or negative), filter title and description containing a match. They can also sort by date or self-rating.
2. `📝Journal entry viewing`: You can click on a journal entry and view the entire entry, and all the keyword tags the entry has.
3. `✏️Creating anonymous journal entries`: Guests can write and share their days about. If they had a great day, they can share all the positive moments they had. In the other hand, if one's having a rainy day, one can dish out their "not so great" moments and put it out there to express oneselves. You can also select keyword event tags in addition, positive, neutral or negative, though it is optional, max 10. (See #4)
4. `🌪️Word filter`: Writing entries and viewing them are subject to a word filter where certain words are filtered out. This bring the term "heated" entries where entries contain such words. Some words will be too heat to be displayed for anyone and cause the journal entry to be "unreadable".
5. `🔥📈Bonfire statistics:` View some statistics of the past 500 or so journal entries (number is not confirmed). These entries are then collected to form statistics which will serve as the "bonfire". The most recent entries will be thrown into the bonfire and analyzed into statistics. (See #10)
